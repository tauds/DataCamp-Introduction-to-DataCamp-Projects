# DataCampIntroduction-to-DataCamp-Projects
his is a DataCamp project! Projects allow you to practice and apply the skills you've learned in the DataCamp courses. In each project you carry out an end-to-end analysis, on a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows. The exception is this project, which is just an introduction to the DataCamp project interface.  On the side, you have a Jupyter Notebook, a free, open source web application that is great for interactive data analysis. A DataCamp project consists of a number of tasks, and here, you have the task instructions. Your first task is easy:  Run the code cell below "1. This is a Jupyter Notebook!" by clicking the run cell button ( â–¶| Run ) or hitting Ctrl + Enter. This will calculate how many children were born per day on average in 2016.
